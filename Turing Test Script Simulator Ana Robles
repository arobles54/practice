# This script simulates a simple medical diagnosis conversation with a user.

# Declare variables
user_input = ""  # User's input placeholder
prompt = "What is your problem?"

# Prompt the user with the initial question
print(prompt)

# Ignore user input
input()

# Prompt the user again
print("Have you had this problem before (yes or no)?")

# Get the user's response
user_input = input()

# Provide a simple medical diagnosis based on user input
if user_input == 'yes':
    print("Well, you have it again.")
elif user_input == 'no':
    print("Well, you have it now.")
else:
    print("I'm sorry, I didn't understand your response.")
